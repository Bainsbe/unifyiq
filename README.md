    <em>Knowledge Assistant to help save time for knowledge workers and improve productivity</em>
</p>

We hold a strong conviction in the power of **open-source solutions** as the foundation for enabling our knowledge assistant to seamlessly gather knowledge from a wide array of content sources. Our ultimate goal is to foster increased productivity for the dev teams through a personalized knowledge assistant. Our vision is that assistant will be able to answer questions from team's shared knowledge residing in apps like slack, wikis, docs, etc. This assistant not only encompasses essential knowledge skills like smart Q&A and smart notifications but also empowers users to personalize and customize their assistant's skill set according to their unique needs and preferences. Together, let's unlock the potential of open-source collaboration to create a transformative knowledge assistant for all.
